                    <p>The years in Aalto University's Guild of Electrical Engineering were a meaningful part of my life. 
                        It all started during my freshman year in 2012, when I fell in love with the engineering community 
                        and became a teekkari.
                    </p>
                    <p>All the events were inventive and fun, but it was the people that really sold it for me. As my first 
                        job in the guild I tutored freshmen. That was one of the best years I have lived and it was crowned 
                        with the honor of being chosen as one of two tutors of the year (in our guild). Next fall I received 
                        a silver pin of achievement in the Aalto University's Guild of Electrical Engineering.
                    </p>
                    <p>It all culminated in 2016, when I served in the Guild's board overseeing our student advocacy.</p>

                    <img src="images/column-2.jpeg" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>How I ended up in the life science/health technology field was through my fascination to biomechanics, 
                        physiology and kinesiology, my efforts to improve my basic health and athletic performance and will to 
                        extend that help to other people.</p>
                    <p>Despite my young age, I have had several physical problems and injuries related to joint pain, 
                        hip malposition and narrow airways. Yet, I still kept working out and ended up making things worse. 
                        Consequently, I attempted to fix them myself, which lead me to study this field on my own and become 
                        fascinated with it. However, I did eventually get smart and ask for professional help.</p>
